# Archive - Original Implementation

This folder contains the original monolithic implementation before the domain-driven restructure.

## Archived Files

- **`app_original.py`** - Original Streamlit app (430+ lines)
- **`calculations_original.py`** - Original calculation functions (730+ lines)  
- **`app_restructured_demo.py`** - Hybrid demo during restructuring
- **`test_calculations_original.py`** - Original test file for monolithic calculations
- **`RESTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md`** - Documentation of restructuring process
- **`README_RESTRUCTURED.md`** - Detailed restructuring documentation

## Context

These files were archived during the domain-driven restructure completed in December 2024. The new modular architecture provides the same functionality with much better maintainability:

- **Domain-driven design** with separated business logic
- **Modular components** for easier testing and maintenance
- **Clean separation** between UI, business logic, and configuration
- **Single responsibility** classes and functions

## Migration Summary

- **1100+ lines** of monolithic code → **Clean modular structure**
- **Single file calculations** → **Domain-specific modules**
- **Mixed UI/business logic** → **Separated concerns**
- **Hard-coded values** → **Centralized configuration**

The new implementation maintains 100% functionality while providing a much cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
