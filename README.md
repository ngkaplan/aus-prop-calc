# Australian Property Investment Calculator

A comprehensive Streamlit web application for comparing different property investment strategies in Australia. This tool helps users make informed decisions by forecasting and comparing the financial outcomes of buying vs. renting vs. investing scenarios with full Australian tax implications.

## üéØ Project Overview

This calculator compares three primary investment strategies:
1. **Buy to Live**: Purchase a property and live in it (CGT exempt)
2. **Buy to Rent**: Purchase an investment property while renting your residence (with negative gearing benefits)
3. **Rent & Invest**: Rent your residence and invest the capital difference in the stock market
